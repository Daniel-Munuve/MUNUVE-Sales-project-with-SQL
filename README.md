# Retail SQL Project

Retail Sales SQL Analysis Project
This project explores a Retail Sales Dataset using SQL to uncover insights into customer behavior, product categories, and sales performance. The project answers key business questions through structured queries, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

# Project Overview
Database: sql_project_p1

Main Table: retail_sales

Tools Used: MySQL (with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled)

Key Focus Areas: Data cleaning, sales performance, customer segmentation, category trends, and time-based sales patterns.

1. # Table Creation & Basic Checks
# Creating the retail_sales table:
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
  transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  sale_date DATE,
  sale_time TIME,
  customer_id INT,
  gender VARCHAR(15),
  age INT,
  category VARCHAR(15),
  quantiy INT,
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  cogs FLOAT,
  total_sale FLOAT
);
# Null Value Checks:

SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE transactions_id IS NULL;
-- Repeat for other columns like sale_date, sale_time, customer_id, etc.
# Data Exploration
# Total Number of Transactions:

# How many sales we have
    SELECT 
		COUNT(total_sale) as total_sales
    FROM 
		sql_project_p1.retail_sales;

SELECT 
		SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
    FROM 
		sql_project_p1.retail_sales;

# How many unique customers we have 
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM 
	retail_sales;

# Business Questions & Analysis

# write sql query to retrieve all columns for sales made on 2022-11-06
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-06';
# write aql query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of Nov-2022.
SELECT
	*
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'clothing'
AND quantiy >=4
AND DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-11';
# write a sql query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category
SELECT
	category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
# write a sql query to find average age of customers who purchased items from the beauty category
SELECT
    AVG(age) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
# write sql query to find all transactions where the total_sale is gretaer than 1000
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > '1000';
# write sql query to find the total nu,ber of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category
SELECT category,
	gender,
    COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
# write sql query to calculate the average sale for each month . find out the best selling month in each year
SELECT * FROM
(
	SELECT
		YEAR(sale_date) AS sale_year,
		MONTH(sale_date) AS sale_month,
		AVG(total_sale) AS avg_total_sale,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank_sales
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
) as t1
WHERE rank_sales = 1;
# write a sql query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales
SELECT 
	customer_id,
    sum(total_sale) as customer_total_sales
from retail_sales
group by customer_id
ORDER BY customer_total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
 # write sql query to find the number of unique customers who purschased items from each category
 SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
# write sql query to create each shift and number of orders (example morning < 12, afternoon Between 12 and 17, evening >17)
with hourly_rate
AS
(
SELECT *,
		CASE
			WHEN HOUR(sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN HOUR(sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            Else 'Evening'
		End as shift_time
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
	shift_time,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM hourly_rate
GROUP BY shift_time;

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project provides an end-to-end analysis of retail sales using SQLâ€”from data validation and cleaning to business insights and customer segmentation. It is useful for businesses looking to optimize their marketing, inventory, and staffing strategies based on real-time data insights.
